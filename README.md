# Audio Steganography 🔊🔐

This project demonstrates **Audio Steganography**, a technique to hide secret messages within audio files in a way that is imperceptible to the human ear.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Allows users to **embed** (encode) secret messages inside `.wav` audio files.
- Supports **extraction** (decode) of hidden messages from encoded audio files.
- Uses Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation to hide binary data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Web Audio API for audio manipulation

## 📂 Features

- **User-friendly interface** for encoding and decoding messages.
- Works with `.wav` audio files.
- Clean UI with minimal dependencies.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Upload a `.wav` file.
2. Type the secret message.
3. Click "Encode" to embed the message.
4. Use the "Decode" option to extract a hidden message from an encoded audio file.

## ⚠️ Note

- This is a basic demonstration and does **not include encryption**. For secure applications, use encryption before embedding.
